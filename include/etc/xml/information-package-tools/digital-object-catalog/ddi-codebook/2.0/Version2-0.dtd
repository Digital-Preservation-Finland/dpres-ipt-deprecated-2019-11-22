<!-- Used to describe record groupings if the file is hierarchical
      or relational. The attribute "recGrp" allows a record group to
      indicate subsidiary record groups which nest underneath; this
      allows for the encoding of a hierarchical structure of record
      groups.  The attribute "rectype" indicates the type
      of record, e.g., "A records" or "Household records." "Keyvar" is
      an IDREF that provides the link to other record types. In a
      hierarchical study consisting of individual and household records,
      the "keyvar" on the person record will indicate the household
      to which it belongs. "Rtypeloc" indicates the starting column
      location of the record type indicator variable on each record of 
      the data file. "Rtypewidth" specifies the width, for files with
      many different record types. "Rtypevtype" specifies the type of
      the indicator variable.  The "recidvar" is the unique ID of the
      variable group itself.                                           -->

     The attribute "name" is a unique identifier for the nCube.
     Following the rules of many statistical analysis systems

     The "sdatrefs" are summary data description references which record
     the ID values of all elements within the summary data description
     section of the Study Description which might apply to the nCube.
     These elements include: time period covered, date of collection,
     nation or country, geographic coverage, geographic unit, unit of
     analysis, universe, and kind of data. 
     The "methrefs" are methodology and processing references which record
     the ID values of all elements within the study methodology and
     processing section of the Study Description which might apply
     to the nCube. These elements include information on data collection
     and data appraisal (e.g., sampling, sources, weighting, data
     cleaning, response rates, and sampling error estimates).
     The "pubrefs" attribute provides a link to publication/citation
     references and records the ID values of all citations
     elements within Section 2.5 or Section 5.0 that pertain to this nCube.
     "Access" records the ID values of all elements in Section 2.4 of
     the document that describe access conditions for this nCube.
     "dmnsQnty" notes the number of dimensions in the nCube. 
     "cellQnty" notes the total number of cells in the nCube.         -->

    population at a given point in time) or a flow (like the number of
    births or deaths over a certain period of time). The non-additive
    flag is to be used for measures that for logical reasons cannot be
