following lines in it:

<nextCatalog catalog="/etc/xml/information-package-tools/digital-object-catalog/digital-object-catalog.xml"/>
<nextCatalog catalog="/etc/xml/information-package-tools/kdk-mets-catalog/catalog-local.xml"/>
<nextCatalog catalog="/etc/xml/information-package-tools/private-catalog/private-catalog.xml"/>
